/*

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, 
return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t 
(including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, 
return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.


Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"

Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.


Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"

Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.


Example 3:    

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""

Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
 

Constraints:

m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 10pow5
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

/*

We're looking for the smallest substring of s that contains all characters 
(with correct frequency) from t.

Use the sliding window technique:


Expand the window to the right until it covers all characters from t.

Then, try to shrink it from the left to find the smallest valid window.
A frequency array helps track how many of each character are still required.
When the window contains all characters from t (required == 0), itâ€™s a candidate.

*/



/*


Time Complexity:
O(sLen + tLen)

We scan t once to build the frequency array: O(tLen)
We expand and contract the sliding window using two pointers: 
O(sLen) in total (each character is processed at most twice).


ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity:
O(1) (Constant space)
Frequency array is of size 128 (for ASCII chars), which is constant.
No additional data structures grow with input size
