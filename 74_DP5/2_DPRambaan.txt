memoization -> top-down -> recursive call wala..
tabulation -> bottom up -> for loop wala

first memoization then its tc, sc, then tabulation tc, sc -> final soln

memoization-> tend to store the value of subproblems in map/table

recursion -> tabulation (bottom up) -> base case to the required answer...

dp hints -> count the total number of ways or    find min or max out of given sample...
where first you apply recursion then apply optimization....

3 step approach 
step 1-> try to represent the problem in terms of index.
step 2-> do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problem statement..
step 3-> take sum / min. of all those stuffs accordingly....

to convert the recurrence to dp -> look at the parameters which are changing...
