/*
procedural vs Oops
procedural -> 


Oops -> scalability code efficient 
we use classes and object
oop is used widely in real world programming

CLASS is a user defined data type. it is basically a BLUEPRINT of the structure.

OBJECT is an instance (execution/parchai) of the class


factors->
1. data abstraction (backend server crucial all things hidden)
reason-> security, user interface

2. data encapsulation -> putting multiple data into a single data
for example player class contains itself is now a data type and contains other data
type like int ammo, int health, char name

3. inheritance -> child apne parents ki properties ko inherit karta hai..
4. polymorphism -> different functionality can be achieved from the same piece of code.
4a-> overloading
4b-> overriding


access modifiers :-> Public -> bahar se koi bhi access kar sakta hai...
 Private-> bahar se koi bhi access nahi kar sakta hai...
  Protected-> bahar se access to nahi but ha aap inherit to kar sakte ho..

-> variable inside class are called data members
-> functions inside class are called member functions
-> class to kewal ek blueprint hota hai...data members ya member function ko to
OBJECT hi invoke karega


oops says ki for security reasons 
1. data members ko private rakho and ab aap thodey naye functions banao...
like setter and getter to set and get data member values..

2. member function ko public rakho...
