// findTheKthSmallestPairDistance.cpp

/*

The distance of a pair of integers a and b is defined as the absolute difference between a and b.

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth smallest distance 
among all the pairs nums[i] and nums[j] where 0 <= i < j < nums.length.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,1], k = 1
Output: 0

Explanation: Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2
(1,1) -> 0
(3,1) -> 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 0


Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,6,1], k = 3
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
2 <= n <= 1e4
0 <= nums[i] <= 1e6
1 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2

/*

ðŸ§  Intuition:
Sort the array so that difference between elements becomes predictable.
Binary search the difference d (range: 0 to max - min) and for each d, count how many pairs (i, j) exist with nums[j] - nums[i] <= d.
If count >= k, then d can be the answer (but we want the smallest such d).
Otherwise, we need to increase d to get enough pairs.


ðŸ“Š Time & Space Complexity:
ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity:

Sorting: O(n log n)
Binary Search: log(range) = log(nums[n-1] - nums[0]) â‰ˆ log(maxDiff)
solve() runs in O(n) (since j only moves forward, not reset)
Total: O(n log n + n log(maxDiff))

ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity:

O(1) auxiliary, as everything is done in-place (excluding recursion stack or output)
