1. string construction
2. infinite graph 
3. integers and operations
4. Graph Construction
5. permutation based problem.
6. Geometry/grid problem
7. precomputation (dp on graph)
8. NP hard problems. (for google)


p1. you are given permutation from 1 to n
in single operation, you can reverse the first i prefix
use minimum operation required to sort the number.

node as permutation 
edge === operation

we need to minimise the number of edges in this graph.


bfs also work with graph with cycles..it finds shortest path by itself.


------ Disguise Recipe -----------

1. creative in creation of node 
    for example node can represent.
        (permutation, circle, )


--> whatever you need to minimise that should be on the edge ... if it is a graph problem.
first focus on the edge.. then think about what should come at node.


problem2-> Big Discs 

given rectangle and N number of circles. if you start from topleft corner 
you can take any path, if there exist a path return yes else return no.


there will be cases where output should be no....

if there is connected chain of circle from top to bottom , left to right, 
top left to up    and right mai bottom to right block nahi hona chahiye...

for each of the n circle 
chain ko left, top , right, bottom named node se connect kiya...


permuatation -> codeforces 
    travelling couple ....

infinite graph -> uber chocolate problem.

NP Hard problem -> TSP, Hamilton problem, -> only brute force works there.


--- projects ------

level 1 projects 
     build x using y 
    

level 2 projects + production settings.
    deploying it on cloud and have knowledge about production settings.

level 3 
     should have live users.

level 4 
    system design integration into the project.
