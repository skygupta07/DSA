/*

There is a room with n bulbs labeled from 1 to n that all are turned on initially,
and four buttons on the wall. Each of the four buttons has a different functionality where:

Button 1: Flips the status of all the bulbs.
Button 2: Flips the status of all the bulbs with even labels (i.e., 2, 4, ...).
Button 3: Flips the status of all the bulbs with odd labels (i.e., 1, 3, ...).
Button 4: Flips the status of all the bulbs with a label j = 3k + 1 
where k = 0, 1, 2, ... (i.e., 1, 4, 7, 10, ...).

You must make exactly presses button presses in total. 
For each press, you may pick any of the four buttons to press.

Given the two integers n and presses, return the number of different possible statuses 
after performing all presses button presses.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1, presses = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Status can be:
- [off] by pressing button 1
- [on] by pressing button 2
Example 2:

Input: n = 2, presses = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Status can be:
- [off, off] by pressing button 1
- [on, off] by pressing button 2
- [off, on] by pressing button 3
Example 3:

Input: n = 3, presses = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Status can be:
- [off, off, off] by pressing button 1
- [off, on, off] by pressing button 2
- [on, off, on] by pressing button 3
- [off, on, on] by pressing button 4
