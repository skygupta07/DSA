->properties of heap
1. heap is hierarchy based data structure
2.heap is a complete binary tree (last row tight packing)
3. it stores the element such that the priority of parent is always greater than priority of children
4. max heap-> every node is having value more than all of its descendants
5. all the subtrees of a heap are also heap..


->complete binary tree properties
1. h = O(logn)
2. the last level has almost half of the total number of nodes in that heap
3. complete binary tree lene se ye fayda hua ki ab koi gapping nahi exist kar rahi
matlab we can represent it in the form of array also....

->parent aur just immediate child ke bich comparison karna hai..
-> bigger the element higher is the priority (max heap)
-> bst wali left chota right bada ye sab bakchodi yaha nahi hogi...

->if parent is at ith index in array then its left child is at: 2i+1 and 
right child is at 2i+2

->if child is at ith index in array then its parent is at [(i-1)/2] floor value..
=> insertion in heap
1. constant time mai element insert kara but to maintain the property of heap 
we need to upheapify/percolate up
2. actual swapping to array mai hi hogi chahe hamara mental model heap ka hi kyu na ho..
3. highest priority or max element will always be sitting on the top



time taken to insert in an heap is min-O(1) to O(logn)
// our most shining apple is on the top === our max element is on top, so we remove them..


=> deleting element in a heap
-> how can we modify the current complete binary tree to a max heap where the 
left subtree is a heap and right subtree is also a heap but the complete tree is not
a heap...
-> intermediate mai jis taraf swapping kar rahe hai ... wahi dikkat ho ja rahi thi 
matlab wahi pe swap karo fir...
-> we can percolate down upto logn height..

-> agar array se directly hi mai arr[0] urf max element ko delete kar du.. tab to
sabko peeche lana hoga O(n) time lagega
-> arey suno array mai last element remove karna sabse easy hota hai..



for max heap -> root element is all about which I am concerned...
to delete root element swap it with last element of array(or with the rightmost element of heap)
then apply downheapify...


idea of heap sort->
whenever we delete element from the heap, max. element of that time is deleted...
also array ke last me jagah bhi khali ho jaati hai, so simply delete karo and ek ek karke     <- <- <- lagate jao
i.e. if you have a heap then delete the element and fill it in the empty place obtained
after deletion

steps:-> you will be given a heap
step1-> create a heap 
step2-> delete all the element from heap 

time complexity : O(nlogn) for creation and O(nlogn) for deletion also
=> total time = 2nlogn === nlogn  for heap sort


heapify fn( takes O(n)) -> different from creation of heap, arey wahi ki instead ki saare leaf nodes
ko hi upheapify karte ussey accha hai ki har node pe jaake ye dekho ki uska koi descendant 
hai kya agar hai to phir compare karke neeche le aao...matlab downheapify laga do.. 


if you implement priority queue with simple array then it may take O(n) time for creation
and deletion, so heap is the best data structure to implement heap as it takes O(logn) only

-> inbuilt mai to queue lagega hi
-> jiski priority sabse jyada wo sabse aage lag jaega.....
-> hume priority queue implement karni hai...abhi tak ke padhe hue data structures
ko tod madod ke try kiya... like arrays se ,,linked list se...binary trees se ..balanced binary tree
ya bst se bhi ....but utna maja nahi aaya...

so here comes a new data structure heap....so by using heap we can implement
priority queues...
