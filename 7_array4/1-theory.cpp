/*

array size decalred inside main fn is of max size 10^6 and outside main fn its size is
of 10^7
if array declared outside the main fn and uninitialsed then it is bydefault initialised
with zero...
and if declared and uninitialised inside main then it is by default initialsed with 
garbage value...
->contiguous memory allocation

-> always follow brute better optimal approach to a given problem...


--------------       -------     ---------         ----------
if I am using the same array given in question then yes I am using that O(N) space
but remember we always specify the extra memory used is: O(1) as we have not created
any new data structure from my end....
