// binaryTreeMaximumPathSum.cpp

/*

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes 
in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. 
Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6

Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.


Example 2:


Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42

Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 1e4].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
