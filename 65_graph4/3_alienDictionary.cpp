/*
whenever we need to read a dictionary ordering 

-> the letters within a word don't tell us much about the order...

-> always comparing two words can give you the correct answer...

simply do node ko connected ke form mai rakho...and compare karo.. alien dictionary word
ko...jaha par bhi char different mila...then jo later word mai aa raha hoga..
wo earlier wale pe depend karega...
so earlier --> later ki taraf edge bana do...


then alien dictionary order can be found out using topological sorting...
