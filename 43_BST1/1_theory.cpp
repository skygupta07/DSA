/*
the entire left subtree of a node should be smaller and every node to the right should
be greater and this applies for all nodes...

advantages
-> no duplicate elements not allowed
-> efficient searching , insertion , deletion
-> usage in implementation of other data structures like sets, maps, priority queues(really imp)

disadvantage
->lack of support of range queries, there arrays vectors are good
-> not that efficient in case of unbalanced tree...

applications
->phonebook
-> dictionary
->stock market analysis

t.c. = O(logn)
worst case O(n)
space same as time complexity...
